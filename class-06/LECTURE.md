## JS Fundamentals: Objects

Objects in javascript are like complex data type entities, while the array is a storage container for many data tytpes, the Object is a single data types, that stores many types of data.

* Information in an object, is stored using key value pairs.

## JS API (application programming interface): The DOM

The Document Object Model refers to an object in the browser.  It is global (meaning it's predefined and available everywhere).  It performs operations on the rendered HTML document.

## Lab Prep: Salmon Cookies

Main goal:  **Calculate the average number of cookies sales per hour, per store.**

* Think of each store as an object.
* What are the store hours.
* For a single hour, generate the number of sales using, min / max customers per hour, average cookie sales per customer.
* For each store, get an array of cookie sale data for each hour the store is open.
